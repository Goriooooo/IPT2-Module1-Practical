### **User Object:**
```javascript
{
  id: "google_user_id",
  email: "user@gmail.com",
  name: "John Doe",
  picture: "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/...",
  createdAt: Date,
  orders: ["ORD-123", "ORD-456"],
  reservations: ["RES-789"]
}
```

### **Order Object:**
```javascript
{
  id: "ORD-1729456789",
  userId: "google_user_id",
  items: [
    { id: 1, name: "Product", price: "$10", quantity: 2 }
  ],
  totalPrice: "$20.00",
  customerInfo: { name: "John Doe", email: "user@gmail.com" },
  status: "pending",
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### **Reservation Object:**
```javascript
